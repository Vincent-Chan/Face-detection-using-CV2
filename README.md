# Face-detection-using-CV2

This is a project that can detect human's face using CV2 in Python.

It can also detect smiles, left eyes and right eyes of the face as well.

- Faces: enclosed in red rectangles
- Smiles: enclosed in green rectangles with turquoise text "Smiling"
- Left eyes: enclosed in yellow rectangles
- Right eyes: enclosed in blue rectangles


# How to run?

Note: 
I expect you have installed Anaconda in your machine. If not, download it from here: https://www.anaconda.com/download

I also expect you should have install numpy and cv2 in your Jupyter Notebook environment as well. If not run the following lines of code to download them:

`pip install numpy`
`pip install opencv-python`



1. Download and put all files to the same folder.
2. Open the Juypter Notebook.
3. Turn on your webcam/camera.
4. Run all the codes once.
5. Smile! :)
6. (If you want to terminate the program, press 'q' key.)
